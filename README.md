## Algorithm
- Frequent itemset generation: generate all itemsets of which support ![img](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cge) minsup.
  - Definition of support: $s(X\rightarrow Y) = \frac{\sigma(X\cup Y)}{T}$
  - Definition of confidence: 
 

- Rule generation: generate high confidence rules from each frequent itemset, where each rule is a binary partitioning of a frequent itemset.
